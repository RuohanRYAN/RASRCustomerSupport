## Project Introduction
Our goal is to create a systematic, reliable, and accurate NLP platform that companies can utilize to answer customer feedback on social media, whether that be a question, complaint, or positive review for an industry. We intend to create a response system which can provide a personalized reply for a userâ€™s comment or tweet.
